# vediochat but better 

A lightweight Google Meet–style platform with an AI enhancement:  
when internet quality drops, the system switches to a text-based fallback where the user's audio is converted to text, sent efficiently, and spoken on the receiver’s side using AI voice synthesis.  
This keeps the conversation smooth even on low bandwidth.

## Features (WIP)
- WebRTC video/audio calling  
- Auto-detect poor network conditions  
- AI fallback mode: speech → text → AI voice on receiver  
- Optional avatar/face recreation (future)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:**  Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js , Express, WebSocket signaling  
- **Media:** WebRTC  
- **AI:** Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, voice cloning models  
- **Extras:** Optional ML modules for avatars & low-latency synthesis

## Current Focus
- Building stable WebRTC rooms  ( want to learn about the webrtc and its implementation )
